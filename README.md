# AWS-IAM-Implementation-in-Cloud-Security
In this project, I explored AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to improve security and access control in AWS environments. The focus was on implementing IAM best practices, integrating IAM with DevOps workflows, and automating security compliance using AWS tools.


IAM policies (permissions)provide user access control, to ensure that users, services, and applications only have the permissions they need for specific requirements. IAM helps in eliminating the need for hardcoded credentials, improving security in applications running on EC2, Lambda, ECS, other AWS services.


AWS IAM  allow centralized authentication across multiple AWS accounts, grants only required permissions to user groups, and users as per their requirement, allowing unnecessary permissions may lead to misuse of AWS resources.


This project provided hands on experience with IAM best practices, security automation, and real-world access control implementations. Understanding IAMâ€™s role in DevOps and security compliance is critical for managing cloud resources securely.


Scope for Future Work is Automating IAM Policy Management where we Implement infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for automated  IAM provisioning. and use AWS IAM Access Analyzer and AI-driven anomaly detection to actively secure IAM permissions.
